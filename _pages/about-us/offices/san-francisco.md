## <a id="the-building">The building</a>

[50 UN Plaza](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/107031) is on historic Market Street between 6th and 7th streets, in the Civic Center neighborhood. The Bay Area Rapid Transit authority (BART) and MUNI both have underground stops at this location, and the historic F Market streetcar line has two local stops at 6th and 7th Streets.

18F SF office is in room #5685 on the fifth floor. When you get off the elevator, go to the left.

There is a lively farmers market literally out our door every Wednesday. There are many historic buildings within walking distance &mdash; San Francisco City Hall and the Asian Art Museum are but two of them!

## <a id="getting-here">Getting here</a>

### <a id="from-sfo">From San Francisco International Airport (SFO)</a>

Public transit from SFO to the 18F San Francisco office is cheap, fairly quick, and convenient. Take the AirTrain from your terminal of arrival to the SFO BART station. Trains run from the airport to downtown between 15 minutes and 20 minutes with the actual travel time around 35 minutes. The office sits right above the Civic Center stop for BART.

### <a id="from-oak">From Oakland International Airport (OAK)</a>

The smaller of the two San Francisco area airports, OAK is just across the bay from downtown. You can hop on the automated monorail from the airport, then change to the BART system train at OAK/Coliseum station. It&rsquo;s a 25 minute ride to Civic Center BART station.

BART Service is M–F, 4 a.m. to midnight; the last train is generally 10 to 15 minutes after the hour. Saturday service is 6 a.m. to midnight. Sunday service is 8 a.m. to midnight.


### <a id="walking">Walking</a>

San Francisco is a very walkable city; there are plenty of hotels, coffee shops, restaurants, and bars within walking distance of the office. Via the F Market streetcar, you can get to the Castro in one direction, or hop on the other direction to the Ferry Building and the piers overlooking the Bay.


### <a id="biking">Biking</a>

There is a developing [bikeshare program](http://www.bayareabikeshare.com) in the city of San Francisco.

Bike parking is next to the loading dock, entered from the far corner at McAllister and Leavenworth. Before you can park your bike, though, you need to print and fill out [this form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0BxUQGw0LW4R9RTl5ZWl3YzF1RzQ/view), and then activate your credential. This means you need to return to the credentialing location where you first initiated the process for your card. (This is probably the federal building at 450 Golden Gate). There are drop-in hours all day on Monday from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. You can also make an appointment. The card also requires you to come up with a six-digit PIN, so have that ready to go.

If you have any questions about this, contact [Victor Valdivizeo](https://18f.slack.com/team/vv).


### <a id="public-transit">Public transit</a>

San Francisco is very accessible by its public transportation system, [SFMTA](https://www.sfmta.com/). The larger Bay Area is also accessible via [BART](http://www.bart.gov/). Taxis, while available, aren&rsquo;t generally necessary for getting around the city, which is only approximately 7 square miles.

[Clipper Card](https://www.clippercard.com/ClipperWeb/) is the Bay Area&rsquo;s transit pass. It works on many of the different public transit systems, including SFMTA and BART. SFMTA one-way fare is $2.25 with a 90-minute transfer (although sometimes you get a bit lengthier time for your transfer). BART fares are based on distance. SFO to Civic Center Station is $8.65; OAK to Civic Center Station is $10.05. See [BART&rsquo;s website](http://www.bart.gov/) for further fare prices.


### <a id="parking">Parking</a>

Don&rsquo;t do it! Your best bet is public transit and/or walking; downtown streets have one ways and can be very confusing. Street parking is horrible, and paid parking is way expensive. But if you do drive, you may park at 355 McAllister Street. The hours for this underground parking structure are 6 a.m. to midnight M–F. Fees vary but $4.50 to $2.00 per hour depending on when you enter garage.


## <a id="how-do-i">How do I&hellip;</a>

You can also learn more about the building's features in the [50UNP Electronic Tenant Handbook on InSite](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/content/612542) and the [50UNP Tenants page](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/category/106999).

### <a id="enter-the-building">Enter the building for the first time?</a>

During business hours (6 a.m. to 6 p.m.), pass through security with your badge visible. Your GSA ID grants you access to the building at any time during those hours.

If you’re having trouble, call one of the points of contact listed above, or give a shout in the #sf channel on Slack.

###<a id="get-my-fingerprints">Get my fingerprints and badge?</a>

You can get them at 450 Golden Gate. [Schedule an appointment](https://timetrade.com/app/usaccess/workflows/usaccess001/schedule/location?wfsid=b07a7e11-baba97f6-b07a7e14-baba97f6-00000003-6ndldh7l376heqavd2983aah4s7tsj4b&appointmentTypeGroupId=hspd12&fs=1). They also have open office hours all day Monday for GSA employees.

Once you’re there, turn right after entering past security, then the MSO office is directly across from IRS. This is also where you can get your card _activated_.

### <a id="attend-orientation">Attend GSA and 18F orientation?</a>

GSA onboarding is typically conducted on Mondays at 50 UN Plaza. 18F SF onboarding takes place after GSA orientation at our office suite. You should receive an email confirming the times that you will meet with your team.

### <a id="guests">Bring in guests?</a>

Meet your guests at the front security desk to escort them in.

Be aware that IDs from [a few states](https://www.dhs.gov/current-status-states-territories) are not acceptable; see that page for the current list of "noncompliant states". For these states, another issued picture ID is required (or they can just show a passport).

If you’re inviting guests to a potluck, point them to our handy [Eventbrite invite](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/18f-potluck-lunch-tickets-9543876993) with all of the security details.

### <a id="access-the-building">Access the building after hours?</a>

If you're a visitor arriving outside business hours, arrange for an 18F staff member inside the office to escort you.

If you're based in SF and want to regularly access the building after hours, you need to fill out the [50 UNP Security Access Card Application](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0BxUQGw0LW4R9RTl5ZWl3YzF1RzQ/view?ts=5605883f). Have someone of authority sign it for you (like Hillary Hartley or Patrick Bateman), then send to the <a href="#helpful-contacts">building manager</a>. Email [Rachel Almeida](mailto:rachel.almeida@gsa.gov) to set up a time to get your fingerprints taken and badge coded for access. Bring your form with you.


### <a id="book-rooms">Book rooms for meetings?</a>

The SF office has small team rooms. You can book other conference rooms using [BookIt!](/gsa-tools-equipment-and-transit/#bookit) Recommended rooms include Yuma and Carson City, because they are [Acano](/acano)-friendly.

Wireless works well in the beautiful courtyard, so work outside for a change!

### <a id="access-a-printer">Access a printer?</a>

Refer to [our printer information document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ikw7kfeY10lnImZHN7zq5wNjaTRBdTPkZj4QG7-z3d0/edit#) for more details.

### <a id="wifi">Get on the wireless?</a>

The guest Wi-Fi network is GSA Guest. The password changes monthly. To get the current password, type “GSA Wireless” into any room on Slack and the current password will pop up.

Non-guest wireless access is available using gsa-wireless and authenticating using your ENT username and password.

### <a id="access-gsa-gov">Access GSA websites from inside the building?</a>

First, make sure you’re on the gsa-wireless network, per the previous section. If you can access other websites but not .gsa.gov websites, keep your laptop open, go to the 4th floor, and you should suddenly be able to access .gsa.gov websites. You can come back upstairs and the new settings will stick. (Preposterous but true.)

### <a id="charge-devices">Charge my laptop or phone?</a>

Many of the power strips turn off automatically, so if you plug in your device but it doesn’t start charging, look for the small power button *next* to the power strip (it’s a little rounded rectangular switch).

### <a id="standing-desks">Adjust a standing desk?</a>

Under the keyboard platform, you’ll find two levers. Compressing the right-side lever allows you to modify the tilt and height of the keyboard platform. Compressing the left-side lever causes the *entire* desk to immediately drop, so it’s wise to keep a hand on the rest of it and remove hot liquids and anything valuable first.

### <a id="leave">Close up if I'm the last to leave for the day?</a>

If you're the last to leave your side of the office (north or south side), take care of these things on your side:

* The fans are set to stay on until 6 pm. If you're leaving after 6 pm and the fans are still on, turn them off.
* Close the windows.
* Turn off the lights. (You just have to turn off the big overhead lights; there are some small lights along the walls and in the team rooms that we can't turn off.)
* Check the other side of the office if you have time.

## <a id="where-are-the">Where are the&hellip;</a>


### <a id="bathrooms">Bathrooms</a>

Men's and women’s bathrooms are just down the hall from the 18F office — walking away from the elevator bays of the building, the men’s room is on the left, and for the women’s keep going down the hall to just past the stairwell on the left.

There is an all-gender bathroom in the Nimitz Suite on the third floor (room 3198), [at the southwest corner of the third floor map here](https://insite.gsa.gov/portal/category/532018). The Nimitz Suite is [a set of conference rooms named after an admiral](http://gsablogs.gsa.gov/gsablog/2014/05/16/a-closer-look-the-nimitz-suite/).

An all-gender bathroom is also available for limited hours on Tuesday through Thursday in the Health Unit, which is in the basement. See the <a href="#health-center">health center</a> section for further details.

### <a id="batteries">Batteries</a>

There are rechargeable batteries throughout the office space. You will find them plugged into sockets charging. Please replace the fresh ones you pulled out with the dead ones for recharging and re-use by another employee.

### <a id="cafeteria">Cafeteria and snacks</a>

There&rsquo;s a cafeteria located on the first floor, serving breakfast and lunch. [Official hours](http://www.gsa.gov/portal/content/200155) (they say they close at 2 pm, but they usually close down around 1:50 pm). The cafeteria has a good salad bar.

There are machines in the basement area with snacks as well as soft drinks.

### <a id="kitchen">Kitchen</a>

To find silverware and dishes: go to the kitchen down the hall (the one with the sink), look in the cabinets.

To find the refrigerators: There's one in the little kitchen room. There's also one in the little "break room" behind the orange wall within our office area (on the UN Plaza side).

What goes in the recycling, composting, and trash bins: The building's default brown paper towels go in compost. For details on other items, see [the recycle/compost/trash lists provided by SF's waste handling company](http://www.recologysf.com/index.php/for-businesses/commercial-recycling-compost-trash).

### <a id="mailroom">Postal mail</a>

There is a gym in the basement area ([Federal Fitness Center](http://www.federalfitnesscenter.com/)), with lockers and a locker room.

## <a id="food-and-coffee">Food and coffee</a>

[Google Map](https://www.google.com/maps/d/u/0/viewer?mid=zMY1nJmKeGBU.kU147P2SgCmA) with lots of food and drink options near 50 UN Plaza.

If you’re looking for people to eat with or suggesting an outing, use the keyword `sfeats` in [#sf](https://18f.slack.com/archives/sf). (This is an alternative to `@here`, which is intrusive for people who want to screen out those notifications). You can also add that to your [Slack highlight words](https://get.slack.help/hc/en-us/articles/201398467-Highlight-word-notifications) to be notified when other people are talking about food.
