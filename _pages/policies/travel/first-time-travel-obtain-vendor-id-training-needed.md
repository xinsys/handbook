1. Fill out [the EFT form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B0Kck5dqF_Ebb0FFZ29RR0JmVVk/view?usp=sharing). _Yes, you probably already did it at orientation, so this seems repetitive. However, there is a good reason for it. [Click here to find out why](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cHGnvUVGzYJkSuW0-2ZEy4g4vwgNLLkZcI1j5JVozDQ/edit#bookmark=id.f206jlg5swxh)._

3. Attach the EFT Form to this email & send.

4. Wait for a reply to this email.
You’ll get a number like **E000xxxxx** in the reply, which is important for the next step.

7. Send Employee ID to [ethan.heppner@gsa.gov](mailto:ethan.heppner@gsa.gov) with your proposed dates of travel, a phone number, and date of birth **from your personal email** [here’s why](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cHGnvUVGzYJkSuW0-2ZEy4g4vwgNLLkZcI1j5JVozDQ/edit#bookmark=id.f206jlg5swxh) to be set up as an “invitational traveler” temporarily. **Stop here for now.**

**For Later** A member of the 18F travel team will make all of your travel arrangements until you can complete the training in OLU and then sign the [CGE Access Request Form](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/file/d/0B0Kck5dqF_EbM3ZRaHRqRHFWSzA/view?usp=sharing).
